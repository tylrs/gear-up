# Norms and Empathy

[Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IaQvh-BH1rLv10_x6kY8INK73pG9wXdUHjf-vu1q9k8/edit#slide=id.g44a1b318e3_1_9)

## Background

- Gear Ups are an intentional and continuously integrated part of the Turing curriculum. They are used to instill the purpose of our mission and aid the student body in building a diverse and inclusive community.
- Gear Ups provide students with knowledge about intersections of identity and institutionalized systems of power, along with data and vocabulary connecting those topics to tech specifically.

## Take Attendance
Depending on the cohort that you're in, Facilitator should pull up the attendance spreadsheet and quickly take attendance. If in a mixed group, pass around a sign-up sheet.

## Opening Activity 
  - Appreciation Bracelets 
Toss a ball of yarn from student to student with appreciations of each other. Students hold onto yarn to create web until everyone in circle has been appreciated. Can use several yarn balls so no one feels left out. Emphasize circle is about unity and connection not who is appreciated first or last.
Cut yarn so each student has a piece for themselves to make bracelet, etc. Connect torn/broken pieces of selves, vulnerability, connection with each other, empathy

## Session Overview

Here's what we're going to do today:

#### 1. Create group norms that will follow our mod throughout our time at Turing.

We'll work in small groups to create norms then agree on a short list together as a cohort.

##### Why

Norms help create a safe/ brave space within our cohort to learn, share, and grow together.

#### 2. Watch a video about Empathy and discuss.

We'll watch a Brene Brown 2 minute illustrated video.

##### Why

Empathy is an important part of being a human and software developer.

#### 3. Journal/ reflect on empathy

We'll journal independently reflecting on our own understanding of empathy.

##### Why

Many of us process things by writing. We'll take opportunities to write and speak to process our learning today.

#### 4. Read a poem.

We'll read a poem by adrienne maree brown called "We Will Not Cancel Us"

##### Why

This poem sets a tone that allows us to share with one another and get in touch with the work necessary to create real social change in the work we do.

#### 5. Pair and share journal responses and discuss the poem.

We'll get into pairs and process our reactions verbally. 

##### Why

Today's conversation should lead us to experience and display empathy for one another and feel a stronger sense of cohesion with the other students in our cohort.

#### 6. Closing Activity

We'll close out with a whip-around. 

## Setup

Chairs and tables available for small group discussions. Students start out seated in their groups.  Facilitator will need a ball of yarn and printed copies of the poem.

## Introductions (10 min)

The facilitator will kick off the session with the group activity. 

## Session overview (5 min)
Walk through the session overview (above) and what you will do today.

## Group Norms (15 min)

Possible Norms:
- Less on point more on purpose
- Get comfortable with discomfort
- Low ego, high impact
- Relationship is the measure of our strength
- Here to do good, not feel good all the time
- Lived experience is invaluable, give space to share it
- Permission to make mistakes, permission to make mistakes, permission to make mistakes!
- Vegas rule: what happens here stays here
- Move up, move back
- Accept others’ lived experiences as truths

### Intro (2 min)
Importance of relationship and community norms in critical conversations. Safe vs. Brave: how to create brave space. Can we ensure safety? How do we attempt to do the least harm?

### Activity (13 min)
Students break into 6 groups (3-4 students each). Each group reviews norms and creates one they want to submit as a cohort norm to follow them throughout their time at Turing. Facilitator records distilled group norms onto PPT, group discusses and votes on final norms. Vote using simple majority on the ones created. 

## Empathy (8 min)

Honoring each others’ lived experiences is important for critical conversations. We’re going to watch this short clip, read a poem and then journal and discuss.

- Journaling
 How does empathy show up in your life? How does it relate to issues of social justice? How does it relate to your career in tech? 

## Poem (10 min)

Acknowledge this poem is deep and can be received in multiple ways. Tell students: You are welcome to take a walk, take some deep breaths, cry, or internalize this in whatever way feels real and necessary to you.

Distribute and read silently.  

Body Check

### Pair and Share Journal Responses/Poem discussion (10 min)
Ten minutes to share responses and discuss how you think this relates to our mission and future work in the tech industry.

## Closing Activity (10 min)
Element Reflection: 
Whip around: Each person will share one of the following: Air (what they’re left thinking with), Fire (what resonated), Water (what they’re feeling), Earth (what they’ll do with this session)

## Assign homework and Gear Up gauge

## Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
 
 Facilitator:  Close with a few final thoughts to summarize the group discussion
