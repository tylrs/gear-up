# Group Think

## Group intros (5 min)
Give groups a few minutes to do introductions of your choice!  (Suggestion:  Names, program, module, hometown)  

## Opening (5 min)

In order to create a diverse and inclusive work environment, we need to consider the barriers to inclusion.  One of those barriers can be Groupthink.   Groupthink is the tendency for members in a given group to gradually drift toward the same beliefs and styles of thinking.  It can be harmful to your team effectiveness, to your products, and ultimately to the individuals on  your team.  Today we are going to dive into understanding more about Groupthink and determining specific ways to challenge Groupthink when we experience it. 


## Where have you seen GroupThink before? (5 min)

Turn and talk for 2 minutes about where you have seen or experienced Groupthink before. Can Groupthink be positive?

*Have students call out examples and create a list of examples that you can put on the whiteboard.*

## What is it? (15 min)

READ: Take 15 minutes to read the following [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/romp-through-group-think-simon-ashworth)  OR this [article](https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/masters-learning-and-organizational-change/knowledge-lens/stories/2012/groupthink-the-role-of-leadership-in-enhancing-and-mitigating-the-pitfall-in-team-decision-making.html)

<b> WRITE: After you are done with the article, review the list of situations on the board.  Answer these questions in your notebook: </b>


	1. How could those Groupthink situations have been avoided?  
	2. Could the tools listed in the article have prevented that situation?



## Discussion (20 min)
In your small groups, discuss:

	1. What are your responses to the article?
	2. How does Groupthink present itself at Turing?
	3. How could Groupthink impact your career as a software developer?
	
*Come together as a whole group to have groups share some key ideas for the last 5 minutes*

## What does this make you want to do? (15 min)

In your small groups, discuss what you could specifically do to be aware of Groupthink in the following places: 

<b>What can you do to protect from Groupthink when you are in...</b>

	Retros
	Cohort Channels
	Professional Development Sessions
	Gear up
	Posses
	In your future job
	
*With the last 5 minutes, have groups go around and share suggestions.  Each group can share a suggestion for a single category.  You may want to write group suggestions on the board.*

## Closing (5 min)

Groupthink is likely something that we all have been a part of without even knowing it.  Consider the suggestions you heard today and continue to educate yourself on additional ways to guard from Groupthink. What can you implement immediately in your next project, cohort retro, or posse? Linked below are some additional resources for you to continue to explore this concept.

### Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
