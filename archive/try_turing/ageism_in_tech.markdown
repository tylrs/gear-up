## Ageism in Tech

### What is Gear Up?

Part of being successful in the programming world is being able to navigate the increasingly complex and diverse world of technology. Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. To us, that means engaging in conversations that are about more than just code, with people who are change agents and those who are brand new to tech. We'd love to engage with you on ageism for the next 30-40 minutes. It's not coding, but communication and empathy are crucial aspects of being a successful programmer who is highly desirable to employers. Turing's full time course also incorporates regular conversations on topics such as the one we will explore today, so for those of you who are interested in applying after this weekend, this will give you a more in-depth feel for what it means to be a Turing student.

### Introductions (5 min)

In groups of 3-4, introduce yourself (name, background, why you wanted to attend Try Turing). Each group should pick a timekeeper to ensure they cover all the discussion questions.

### Ageism Background (12 min)

Read the following articles on ageism in tech.
  * [Steven Levy on Ageism in Tech](https://medium.com/backchannel/how-can-we-achieve-age-diversity-in-silicon-valley-11a847cb37b7#.68wfpepu4)
  * [Is Ageism in Tech an Under the Radar Diversity Issue?](http://www.fastcompany.com/3054204/the-future-of-work/is-ageism-in-tech-an-under-the-radar-diversity-issue)

### Discussion (15 min)

In your groups, discuss the following questions:

* Both articles describe ageism as part of "tech culture," but how does that actually work? How do leadership and individual choices, words, and actions _create_ this culture? Give some examples.
* How do you expect you will you be affected by these norms and practices? Will you benefit or suffer from them? How?
* Imagine these three scenarios and discuss what you would do in each situation. For each scenario, consider "Are _my values_ aligned with what's happening?" and "Do _my values demand action_? If so, what action would be consistent with my values?"
  * You are 25 and work at Facebook when Mark Zuckerberg makes the comment, "young people are just smarter."
  * You are on an interview team that interviews a 45-year-old candidate who is qualified to do the job. In your team's interview debrief, your colleagues raise concerns that (you believe) have undertones of ageism ("culture fit" and "trouble adjusting to our environment" came up).
  * You run a Ruby meetup hosted by a local tech company. It's an informal, casual group, with 8-9 regular attendees. Obscure lingo and inside jokes are par for the course. You've noticed that each meeting gets 2-3 new visitors, but they rarely return.

### Recap (3 min)

* What are the key takeaways from your group?
* Going forward, what will you be more aware of? What part will you play in tackling the ageism issue in tech?
