# Getting Better at Difficult Things

## Introduction
As we watch Kathy Sierra's video and read Ta-Nehisi Coates' article, pay attention to both presenters' assumptions about your agency as a learner. What new ideas do they introduce about 1) your awareness of your learning experience, 2) the efficacy of your learning experience, 3) and your overall mindset as a learner?

## Write (10 min)
In the context of these presenters' ideas, reflect on the following questions. 
- What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?
- How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
- What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?

## Group Discussion (15 min)
As a group, discuss your answers to the questions above.

### Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
