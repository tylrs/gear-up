## Background
Gear Ups are an intentional and continuously integrated part of the Turing curriculum. They are used to instill the purpose of our mission and aid the student body in building a diverse and inclusive community.
Gear Ups provide students with knowledge about intersections of identity and institutionalized systems of power, along with data and vocabulary connecting those topics to tech specifically.
