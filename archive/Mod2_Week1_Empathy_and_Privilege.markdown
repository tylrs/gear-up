# Empathy and Privilege

## Background

We are going to connect today to our previous discussion on intersectionality. We are working within a framework that validates and recognizes the multiple facets of each individual's identity, recognizing that these different identity markers can carry varying levels of oppression, marginalization, and privilege. 

***Privilege*** refers to the advantages that individuals and groups are afforded in systems of power (communities, organizations, countries, families, etc.). Often, conversations about privilege become ones where stark lines are drawn between "haves" and "have-nots"; we're aiming for a slightly different discussion today, where we'll focus on how privilege and oppression affect our relationships with each other and how we can navigate these dynamics to work better together.

Reminder/Check for Understanding: 
**Intersectionality**: an analytic framework that attempts to identify how interlocking systems of power impact those who are most marginalized in society.
**Marginalization**: treatment of a person or group as powerless, insignificant or peripheral.
**Oppression**: the systematic mistreatment of people within a social identity group, supported and enforced by the society and its institutions, solely based on the person’s membership in the social identity group.


## Take Attendance
Depending on the cohort that you're in, Facilitator should pull up the attendance spreadsheet and quickly take attendance. If in a mixed group, pass around a sign-up sheet.

## Cohort Introduces Norms 
The cohort introduces their norms from Mod 1 to the Facilitator. 

## Session Overview

Here's what we're going to do today:

#### 1. Review a list of statements that describe the different ways people in our society may experience privilege or marginalization.

Everyone will interact with these statements differently because we all walk in the door today with different experiences. That diversity of experiences is a strength of our community.

##### Why

These statements help illustrate how varied our experiences of privilege/marginalization/oppression are, and will help every individual in the session connect with different sides of the power dynamic.


#### 2. Write/reflect on how, as an individual, your unique experiences of privilege and oppression have affected your sense of connection to those around you.

Inevitably, everyone will have some experiences that roughly fit in the category of being oppressed, and everyone will have some experiences that roughly fit in the category of being privileged. One thing that these experiences share is they both seem to have a pretty profound effect on people's feeling of connection to those around them. We will set aside a period of time to write and reflect on both types of experiences. 

##### Why

Today's discussion will rely on taking the academic topic of privilege and relating it to our day-to-day lives. While the first exercise helps people connect personally to the topic, writing provides everyone some space to more fully process the effect of those experiences on our relationships with each other.


#### 3. Meet in groups to discuss what came up during our writing

We'll organize in groups of 4-5 to review the material we wrote on and work together to explore the topic with one another.

##### Why

Sharing and listening are both an important part of processing this material. We learn by figuring out how to articulate complicated experiences respectfully; by listening, we have a chance to learn from others and appreciate how our experiences connect us.


#### 4. Discuss how these dynamics affected our ability to work together last inning.

We'll continue discussion in the same groups, but pivot to some new questions focused specifically on ways in which privilege and oppression shape our experience at Turing.

##### Why

Today's exercise is intended to help all the individuals in your class develop awareness and empathy around privilege so that you can make meaningful changes to how you interact in your remaining 5 months together. Pivoting the discussion towards real life, right now, helps us continue to direct this conversation from something cerebral to something that makes a difference in people's lives today.


#### 5. We'll wrap with some private reflection.

We'll take a few minutes to tie all this back to what we can each do, as individuals, to stay connected.

##### Why

Ultimately, today's conversation should lead to individuals' ability to connect with others in spite of experiencing privilege differently in the dynamics they share. Individuals need time to tie this really complex topic back to what they can do, today, to connect and do right by others who are affected by privilege, oppression, and marginalization.


## Setup

Chairs and tables available for small group discussions. Students start out seated in their groups.  Print the statements and reflection questions for students. [Print](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rXmM8pduOoASfqxxg9n_JEvwfnDWG4YHlOUUxpH71U/edit?usp=sharing)


## Introductions (10 min)

The facilitator will kick off the session by reviewing the overview described above. After that overview, small groups will do whip around to each member: every individual should share briefly how they're feeling (concerns about the session, lunch coma, TGIF).

## Session overview (5 min)
Walk through the session overview (above) and what you will do today. Before we begin, we want to make sure that we have some norms for the conversation.  Everyone has different experiences and different perspectives.  As we start to engage, remind ourselves of our Gear Up Norms.

## Discuss (25 min)

We'll meet in groups to discuss what came up during our writing. Please be attentive to being respectful, active listeners.

## Final Discussion (10 min)

Final Prompt: Connect your experience in this activity, our previous discussion on empathy, and your perspective-taking homework assignment from Mod 1. 

- How can we at Turing work together to create a more inclusive environment? 
- Think of three specific action items you and your group are willing to take.

Take time to share out some reflections from the group and share any reflections you have from the conversations.
 
  
### Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
 
 Facilitator:  Close with a few final thoughts to summarize the group discussion
