# Tragedy of the Commons

## Mission Alignment

*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.*

We are confronted on a daily basis by social challenges that seem bigger than we are. It's often difficult for us to see the connection between small choices we make and these issues, but they are often connected. And when we are able to make the connection, it's not always obvious how we can best have an impact. Today, we will explore this quandary in more depth and brainstorm ways to deal with it.


## Goals of Session

Students should be able to do the following.

*   Draw connections between individual attitudes/actions and large-scale cultural issues.
*   Describe the types of actions that are required to reverse systems created with bias.
*   Demonstrate commitment to community values by reviewing new material through the lens of its relevance in advancing larger community goals.
*   Contribute meaningfully to activities focused on how to advance community values.

## Introductions (10 min)

Fun intro: Faciliators choice!

## Exploring (10 min)

Read and interact with [Parable of the Polygons: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society](http://ncase.me/polygons/). Make sure you read and have a solid understanding of how the creators arrived at these conclusions.  

**1.** Small individual shortcomings lead to large collective failures.  
**2.** Systemic issues from the past are unlikely to be remedied by neutral responses in the present.  
**3.** Small individual "anti-biases" can address systemic biases.  


## Write (10 min)  
### Facilitator, please write at least two of these questions on the board that you'd like the group to discuss

We'll explore the concepts from *Parable of the Polygons (PotP)*  within the context of diversity in tech.

*   Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?
*   Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. *PotP* does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?
*   Given the patterns illuminated by *PotP*, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?
*   *PotP* speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.
*   *PotP* is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are *PotP*'s goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?


## Discussion (25 min)

In groups of 3-4, discuss your answers to the questions above and your suggestions on how we could make positive changes at Turing. 

## Whole Group Discussion (15 min)

Bring together your groups and share reflections to at least two of the questions.  

### Final Reflection (5 min)
Please have students complete the Gear Up reflection in their personal Gear Up gist, answering these questions:

* What are you left thinking about from today's session?
* How do you think the concepts covered in Gear Up today will impact you as a software developer? 3-5 sentences
* Any additional thoughts on the session today?

These reflections will take the place of Gear Up Surveys, and students should continue using that same gist to reflect throughout the module.
