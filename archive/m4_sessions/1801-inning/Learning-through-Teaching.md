# Learning through Teaching

Group goal: 
  * Show the mutual benefits of and potential steps towards offering your time to help others grow in their own developmental skills, not only at Turing, but how you can carry that into the professional world.

Group Members:
  * Hugh Hartigan
  * Thomas Laird
  * Marshall Houston
  * Adrian Lara

Name of Session:
  * Learning Through Teaching

Session Description (Why should students come to this session):
  *  You're gripping the edge of a cliff, about to slip, when a hand reaches out to grab you and pulls you to solid ground. You've been there before and you'll be there again. Figure out why you learn the most through helping others.

Session Outcomes (What will students learn/leave with?):
  * Collaborate on best strategies for teaching and learning, as well as how to be a good mentor/mentee while at Turing and the tech world at large. Oh, and you might learn a little bit about black holes.

Session Outline (Please include who is facilitating and how much time you are going to spend in each section):

1. Intro / Annecdotal (Group) (10 minutes) - Hugh
  * Introductions and ice breaker
  * Annecdote about Turing and personal story: IdeaBox

2. Exercise to partner up and teach the other person something (10 minutes) - 2 person groups
  * Two articles for people to explain to one another (non-technical)
  * Read it, teach someone else

3. Debrief (Group) (10 minutes) - Marshall
  * What changes in knowledge from reading to teaching?
  * Research
  * Guiding questions

4. Talk about strategies (10 minutes) - 4 person groups each with one leader
  * What were strategies when you had to teach?
  * What were strategies when you had to learn?

5. Come back as a group and identify core strategies to being a good mentor or mentee (10 minutes) - Thomas
  * Crowd source best strategies and add to as needed
  * How to be a good mentee
    * (List TBD)
  * How to be a good mentor
    * (List TBD)

6. Call to action (10 minutes) - Adrian
  * What you can do in Turing: Iron-FE, Berrilium, Joan Clarke
  * Why doesn't it happen? What are potential pitfalls?
    * If you're doing, what is good or what could be better?
    * If you're not doing it, why not or what do you need to make it happen?
  
7. Broader tech world (10 minutes) - All
  * What does the group think they can do moving forward?
  * What you can do out in the real world: Meetups, Coming back to Turing, helping Jr devs
  
8. End with questions, 'Thank You'
