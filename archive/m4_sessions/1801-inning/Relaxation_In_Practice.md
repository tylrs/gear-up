Session Description (Why should students come to this session):  Students who come to this session will learn and practice techniques to help them relax during stressful times. They will also reflect on what strategies will work for them (or already work for them), and how to recognize when it is time to use these techniques and step away from the computer.

Session Outcomes (What will students learn/leave with?): Students will leave with an awareness of how important it is to make time to do activities that relax you. They will also have a clear list of activities they're interested in, and a Slack channel set up to share ideas and for support.
