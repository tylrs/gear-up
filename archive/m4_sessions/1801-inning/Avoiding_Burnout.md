Group Members: Avoiding Burnout

Name of Session: Julie D, Rob M, Pat, Miguel

Session Description (Why should students come to this session):

Newsflash: Turing is difficult.  While stress is expected and burnout is always looming, there’s hope!  We’ll spend our time discussing how to identify burnout, and how to avoid it while at Turing, and in life after.

Session Outcomes (What will students learn/leave with?):
• Students will learn how to identify burnout
• What causes burnout/ how it's different for different people
• What you can do to combat burnout

Session Outline (Please include who is facilitating and how much time you are going to spend in each section):

——HOW TO AVOID BURNING OUT——

JULIE - 1:00-1:10
Intro/Icebreaker
Question: What makes you happy?

————

ROB - 1:10-1:20
We want to get you thinking about what kind of person you are.  Do you get more stressed or burned out?  Or both?  Are you more introverted or extroverted?  Does that make a difference?  How do you allocate your cognitive resources?  What kinds of things give you energy—what makes you able to work long hours, to be productive even when stressed, and finally how do you work hard (which you’ll have to do at Turing) without getting burned out?

Potential Questions:  What is the difference between stress / burnout?  (write on board)
What causes stress?  What causes burnout? (write on board)

JULIE - 1:20-1:30
Introverts vs Extroverts
Potential Questions:  No one is purely introverted and no one is purely extroverted.  But who in this room would identify themselves as being more introverted?  Who would say they are more extroverted? 

Hear from both types:  
If you are more introverted, what causes you stress and what causes burnout?  (take a few answers)
If you are more extroverted, what causes you stress and what causes burnout? (take a few answers)

IN GROUPS - 1:30-1:45
Read article.  When you are done reading, talk with your group about what are the signs of burnout for you specifically.  Leave time for each person in your group to talk, then we’ll come back together.

————

MIGUEL - 1:45-1:55
Potential Questions: We’ve talked about who you are, and how each person experiences stress, hard work, and burnout differently.  Each person is triggered by different factors.  How do you identify the signs of burnout, specific to you?  (Take several answers and make sure to hear from each group)

—————

PAT - 1:55-2:05
Potential Questions: Now that we’ve thought about what might cause you to burn out, let’s talk about the opposite.  Let’s talk about the opposite of burnout: What motivates you to work?  What makes work fun or easy?  Where do you do your best work?

ROB - 2:05-2:13
Thinking through our discussion and the article we read—what are 3 strategies that you can apply to your life this week?
There are 10 minutes left.   Talk in your group—what are 3 strategies that you will use yourself?
