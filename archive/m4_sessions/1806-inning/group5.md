## Session Outline

 2. Intro to ei - Description and surface level explanation. (5 minutes, slides 3-6, lead by Megan)
 3. Article reading and discussion (20 minutes)
     - We'll assign three groups. Each group gets 5 minutes to read one of the following articles:

          2. [The Importance of Emotional Intelligence at Work](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245755)

          3.[Inside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html)
     - Then, each group has a 10 minute discussion with the following prompts:

          1.
          * Have you paired with someone at Turing who you think demonstrates these traits? (13 traits article) Did that help your project? How?
          * Which of these skills do you think you have? How has it helped you?
          * Which of these skills do you wish you were better at? Why?

          2.
          * Have you worked with someone that exhibited these traits?
          * Have you worked with someone that didn't exhibit these traits?

          3.
          * Do you think it's possible to be emotionally intelligent and do good work?
          * Would you be willing to work in a place that's unwilling to acknowledge your feelings or mental state?

      - Finally, each group shares a takeaway from their discussion with the larger group. (5 minutes)

    4. Group activity, lead by Megan. (20 - 30 minutes)
    - Follows this format : https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/40880/a-simple-exercise-to-strengthen-emotional-intelligence-in-teams
    ^ Megan will adjust the format to follow either option 1 or 2 depending on how fast the above activities happen. If it goes fast (eg, not much discussion), she'll follow option 2. Otherwise, she'll follow option 1.  

    5. Wrap up discussion (5 minutes)
    - Thanks for coming to this session. It's hard to quantify emotional intelligence and it's harder to convince people of it's worth. For last piece of our session we want to ask you: How do you think that we should talk about emotional intelligence? Should we?
