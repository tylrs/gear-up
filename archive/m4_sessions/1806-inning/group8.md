## Name of Session:
All These Flavors and You Chose to be Salty

## Session Description
Turing is hard... It can be easy to feel salty about things here. There's a better way! This session will discuss the benefits of being positive.  We are positive you'll love this session!

## Session Outcomes

* tools for changing your mindset from negative to positive
* Action item: change mindset about something they are negative about.

## Session Outline

(Please include who is facilitating and how much time you are going to spend in each section):
Introduce the session and goals for the day
Intros - Name, Mod, Why did you come to Turing
Line up in the room from 'most positive' to 'least positive'
     Pair with someone opposite side of the room - discuss things at Turing that make you negative and why
     Share Out
Group presenting
     - brain impact of positive and negative thinking
     - How to recognize when you're being salty or something.
     - Ways to change mindset (also ask group for examples)
     - Turing positivity and cohort dynamics
Revisit initial discussion (something negative) and go back to original groups and think of strategies to reframe the situation.

     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
