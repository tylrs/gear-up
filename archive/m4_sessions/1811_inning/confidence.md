## Name of Session: The Confidence Gap

## Session Description 

(Why should students come to this session):

Come explore current research on the relationship between confidence and competence (is there one?) and learn how to grow your own confidence and support others' confidence in our new careers as developers.

## Session Outcomes 

(What will students learn/leave with?):
A toolbox: 
1. Awareness of behavioral economic data / trends / research on the topic of confidence
2. How to build confidence (strategies)
3. How to help others build confidence ("spotlight" and other strategies to support others)

### Trajectory 

* ice breaker
* (10 min) give an intro of why we are here - explain what the confidence gap is, what are the consequences
* count off to form groups at random
* break students into 2 groups with a 2-3 moderators for discussion/skits
* give out snacks / gold coins
* share when you felt confident and not confident and why
* read a brief article snippet (possible connection between pay/success and confidence)
* discussion
* wrap up as a small group
* wrap up as a whole group (superhero pose / power pose)


     Best practices:  No section should be longer than 20 minutes
     Create a session that YOU would want to attend
     Share resources in your slack channel
     All sessions NEED to have a closing activity, reflection, discussion
