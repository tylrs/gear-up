3. () Activity on Designing for a specific issue/problem.  Topic and leading questions.
     Students will choose a group with a topic they want to explore.
     
     5 Domains of Civic Tech
          Government Data, Community Organizing, Crowd Funding, Social Networks, Collaborative Consumption
          
     Leader facilitation
     Each group is given a target user/group. They must define a problem this fictional person has within the realm of their domain. 
     
     Target Users:
          Oprah's campaign manager 2020
          School Principal
          City Council Member
          Working Parent
          Retired Baker
          

First groups will have two minutes to role play. One person will play the role of the target user and the others will ask them questions to further define and understand the scope of their problem.
     
     Each group gets a poster paper-
          Define the problem
          Define the target user
          Draw wireframe of the app and what it will do.
