## Name of Session: The F Word: Redefining Failure

## Session Description 

(Why should students come to this session): Are you afraid of failure? Do you hate the feeling of failing? Come to this gear up session to change your perception of failure and redefine it as a normal part of life that is a part of growth and a step towards success.

Students who might be afraid of failure or who have failed in the past and do not feel good about it.

## Session Outcomes 

(What will students learn/leave with?): Redefinition of failure to a positive. Normalization of talking about failure. An understanding that if you aren't failing, you are probably not challenging yourself, so you should embrace failure as proof of personal growth. Leave feeling encouraged to fail.
