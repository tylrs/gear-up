## Name of Session: Legends of the Hidden Data: An Intro to Data Visualization

## Session Description 

(Why should students come to this session): Interested in data visualization and want to find out how to use it at Turing? Come to this session for an overview of data vis technologies in multiple coding languages, specifically tech you can use in your projects at Turing. Learn how to intelligently present graphs and data visuals, including a basic understanding of causation and correlation in data. Put it all together in a creative, hands-on activity using real APIs and colorful markers.

## Session Outcomes 

(What will students learn/leave with?): 
- A general understanding of data visualation technologies in multiple coding lanuages, including specific technologies you could use in Turing projects
- A hands-on opportunity to hone your thinking around how to create visuals for related data using real APIs
- Words of the trade when it comes to presenting graphs and data visuals, including a basic understanding of causation and correlation in data

### Recommended Trajectory / Session Outline
(1 hr 10 mins)
#### All
- Intros: 10mins
- Presentation: 30mins
#### Alex B.
- Intro to data visualization technologies in multiple coding languages: 7 minutes  
  - Short non-Turing video? videos?
  - Lightning talk presentation to condense that we could share in channel
(Specific video(s) on Turing do-able techs)
#### Autumn M.
- End with Specific technologies you can use at Turing (5 - 7 mins)
  - GraphQL, D3.js
(Short video on correlation / causation / how to present data)
#### Cole H.
- Basics of correlation and causation and words of the trade (5 mins)

#### Drake B.
- Hands on Activity: (20 mins)
2-4 APIs (NewsAPI.org, DarkSky (weather), Unsplash (copywrite free photos)), 

We - give Docs packet of info for each API with a summary of available data
They - psuedocode or sketch the data visualizations they would find interesting from that data

#### All
Wrap up discussion (10 mins)

### Resources needed: 
- digital presentation, 
- videos, 
- markers, 
- flip boards, 
- printed pamphlets
