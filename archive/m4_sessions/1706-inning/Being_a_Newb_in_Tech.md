## Gear-up title: Being a Newb in Tech (aka Don't be a Selfish Bastard)

### Tagline:

_Do you think you're too new to make contributions to those around you? You're not, you can start tomorrow, and everyone (yourself included) will be better for it!_

#### Other possible titles:
- Giving back, even (especially) when you think you can't
- Helping others for fun and profit
- How not to be a selfish bastard
- leverage your inner newb for good
- making contributions in an industry where that's rewarded



# Session outline:


### 1. Do we have a responsibility to "give back"?

### 2. Have attendees make list of all things they know AND all the ways they've been helped by folks in their current mod or mods ahead.  (put these questions on screen) (led by Valary)

---- budgeting ten minutes to this point ----

### 3. watch [video](https://youtu.be/nXIIW8TusWw?t=9m58s) (8 min) (Sergey)

---- now 18 mins in ----

### 4. Brainstorm how they can get involved (turn and talk) (5 min) (Sergey)

### 5. collect their answers on white board (4 min), Discuss their answers (John B)


---- 27 min in ----


### 6. Now we can share some of our ideas
  - Making PR in Turing repo (John)
  - host lunch-time in-mod session

  **To Discuss:**

> 1. Talk about how to make a PR against a lesson (gist w/instructions?) (John B) ([demo against this repo](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/ideabox.md))
> 2. In-person involvement (like TryTuring). You're most qualified to help at a try-turing event after _mod 1_. (Kelley M)
> 3. lunch & learn, spikes. Jump into channels to answer questions (Josh)

--- ~ 45 mins in ---

### 7. Closing question: circle back to "do we have responsibility to give back?"
  - who can giving back help the most?
  - who do you want to make an impact on when you do give back? (consider yourself!)

### 8. Give deliverables for PD session

- Dates for upcoming Try Turing events
- Valarie's PD template
- Josh's PR practice (if you want)
