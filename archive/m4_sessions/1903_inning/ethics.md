#Update Group 1: Ethics in AI

## Why should students pick this session?
To equip themselves to understand the ethics and problems revolving around artificial intelligence - one of the most important issues of the next century.

## Discuss
* What is AI?
* For the people who are worried about it, what are they worried about?

## Issues
#### Human dignity
The effect on us of losing human interactions. Joseph Wasenbaum - "AI technology should not be used to replace positions that require respect and care. Customer service reps, nursemaids for the elderly, police officers. If machines replace them, we will find ourself alienated...." Counter argument from Pamela McCordic.
#### Implications on security/privacy
“I like my Alexa, but I don’t like being recorded and monitored.”
#### Automation > Labor
How do we manage this as a society? Is it worth it? Charles Murray.
#### Difficulty verifying/pinpointing mistakes
Black Box Problem (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/)
  
#### Other Topics
* Machine consciousness
* How does this relate to us as developers of software? (Developers that write code that writes code...). 
* Human emotion is flawed, is this why we need machines?
