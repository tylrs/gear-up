# Turing Career Development: Automation: Job Elimination 101

## Session Outcomes

As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually. Our mission at Turing is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.
