* (5) What is privacy? What does it mean to you?
```
From Wikipedia: "Although the US Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the 4th Amendment."

An Israeli law school came up with the following: "Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives." 

There isn't actually a fundamental protection for our privacy. It falls on each of us to protect ourselves.
