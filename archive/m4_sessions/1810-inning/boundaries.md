## Session Outline 

- Brief Introduction

- Small group discussion about last time we set boundaries and how it made us feel, talking candidly about what makes us uncomfortable.  (We will break out into 2 groups. 2 facilitators per group.)

- Using chocolate coins as no currency in a "no" based activity (this needs refinement! But it's gonna be fun and informative and fun!!!).

(Please include who is facilitating and how much time you are going to spend in each section):
