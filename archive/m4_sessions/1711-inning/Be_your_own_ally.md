## Group Seven

### Session Title: 
Be Your Own Ally

#### Description: 

#### Why should students come to this session?
Turing and life are hard enough. If you are a minority, introverted, or just inexperienced with collaboration, it can be even harder. Women and other minorities in tech many times find themselves in difficult pairings.This session is designed for women and minorities in tech, especially those who don't feel comfortable speaking up for themselves. Participants will build a toolbox of strategies one can use to be a effective self-advocate in pairing and project teams.

- how to advocate for yourself in pairing
- how to respectfully make sure your voice is heard
- how to address microaggressions
- when to involve other people

### Session Outcomes: 

#### What will students leave with or gain from this session?
- Participants will walk away with stratgies to productively address microagressions and any other interpersonal challenges that may arise from a pairing or team.
- Participants will walk away with insight into issues that other students face and reflect on how to also advocate for others

#### Scenario Rotation - Luke, all - 26 min
- Scenarios and discussion
- We’ll have four stations w/ a scenario for each and collect ideas on each scenario to share at the end of the exercise 
   
1. You're in your future job. The senior dev you are pairing with refuses to truly listen to your input. You have tried to suggest things to console log, debug, etc. but the response is constantly something like, "No, that won't work." What can you do to navigate this?
2. You are paired for a week-long project with a classmate.
- A few days in, your partner starts failing to honor some of the commitments made in the DTR (coming to work time late, leaving early with little notice, etc.). 
- You commited to working on a certain (difficult) feature together, but you find them in the classroom working on it alone. You ask them to plug in, and they say they'd rather work alone. You are worried that you won't learn this piece of technology as well because you weren't able to be a part of writing this code. 
3. During an open discussion Posse/Gear Up session, one individual monopolizes the conversation. You have something to add to the conversation, but don't feel there is an 'in' to speak up.
4. You are paired with a classmate for a week-long project. The partnership is not balanced - on technical understanding/confidence in technical ability - the project is not progressing and one partner doesn't feel safe to ask questions about the project.

#### Closing - Hector - 15 min
- Journaling (5 min)
- Final reflection (10 min) 
1. Think back to a time at Turing where you felt like you could not advocate for yourself. How would you act different with the knowledge you have now?
2. In reflection, is there a time at Turing where you may have created an environment that made it difficult or challenging for someone else to speak up for themselves?
3. Is there a strategy or phrase that you have added to your toolkit if/when you run into a challenging pairing in the future?
4. Another other takeaways.
