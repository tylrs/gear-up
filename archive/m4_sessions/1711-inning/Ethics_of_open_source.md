Group Three

Session Title: Ethics of Open Source

Description: The entire software industry is built on open source, and licensing can be confusing. We will look at some of the key ideas that have shaped open source, and the trajectory of open source. We will talk about how to ensure a sustainable open source ecosystem, and how to help developers continue to maintain that ecosystem.

Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session? A better understanding of many of the tools we all use everyday, and how important it is that those tools continue to be available.

Session Outline: Include the flow of the session and the time for each section.

15 mins Icebreaker/intros. Eddie will lead this section. "Do you have a nickname?"
5 min video on what is open source? Will add content. Currently we have a bunch of videos that could work. We need to sort out which one to use. We'll have that done by EOD Monday.
[7 mins article on licensing and license differences.](https://lukasa.co.uk/2012/05/GPL_vs_MIT_Which_License_To_Use/) Ash will lead this topic.
8 mins discussion on licenses based on reading.
What do you see as the pros and cons of the licenses listed? What would you use and why? Do you see any possible problems with any of these licenses?
[30 mins discussion prompted by slides made from this article. One ethical lens (slide) at a time, then a discussion about that slide.](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/internet-ethics/resources/unavoidable-ethical-questions-about-open-source/) Discussion will be 2-3 mins turn and talk, then 5-6 mins group discussion for each slide. Each slide is in the form of a question. We will prompt the discussion if there is total agreement, but that seems unlikely given the questions. We will alternate leading the discussion on each slide.
10 mins closing
Major questions: How can you contribute? Do you feel like it is important to contribute? What will you do in the future?
