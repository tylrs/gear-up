## Group Seven's Session Plan

M4 Student Leaders: Stephanie, Robbie, David, Annastasia

# Turing Career Development: Automation

## Session Outcomes

## Mission Alignment		 
  		  
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.
  		  
As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually. Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.

## Pre-Session


### Survey Questions

Survey Questions to share with instructional staff by Wednesday of the same week.

1.   What value would you assign to this session (from 1-5)?
2.   What are you taking away from this session?
3.   What role, if any, does Turing play in taking responsibility for this issue?


### Pre-Reading

Send pre-reading out at least 24 hours before the session

### Groupings

*   What should the group size be for discussions? (Recommend 3)
*   How should groups be set up? (Recommend some meaningful grouping)


### Logistics

| Set Up | Materials Needed |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| Students should start the session where ever they want. | Participants need notebooks, pens. |  |


## Session Outline

| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points           | Participant/Facilitator Actions  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 2 min | Introduction: Welcome participants.  Introduce ourselves.  Review the outcomes for the session and the connection to the greater Turing mission.  |
| 8 min | Warm Up: Each student will be insstructed to get a computer to multiply 2 ^ 64 (1 min) and 1min to code a box into existence. Students will then organize in the room along a spectrum of their attitudes toward automation. Describe one end as representing people who feel strongly that automation is, as Elon Musk says, "summoning a demon." On the other end, people who feel automation is going to take humanity to new, positive, exciting potential. (For students in the middle, at least one must choose the opposite view point - devil’s advocate (without being a troll).) (Stephanie will facilitate, Robbie will demonstrate his box) | Facilitator will instruct students to line up in between these poles as appropriate. At facilitator's prompting, students should line up along the spectrum of attitudes toward automation. |
| 2 min | Introduce video and reflection questions to students. <br> 1) How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire? <br> 2) Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes? <br> 3) What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue? <br> 4) What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?  <br> | Anna will facilitate. Students get out paper and pen to prepare for video. |
| 15 min | Kick off ["Humans Need Not Apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) video. | Students should take notes during the video.  Ask them to put away cell phones/computers if needed. |
| 10 min | Kick off ["Do labor-saving robots spell doom for American workers?"](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/labor-saving-robots-spell-doom-american-workers/) video | Remind students to review questions and take notes. |
| 5 min | Invite students to reflect further on the questions in writing. (Robbie will faciliate) | Students should be writing. |
| 13 min | Introduce discussion section: Students should identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing. After individual sharing, the group facilitator can help the group decide what themes from people's writing to discuss in more depth. | Facilitator: walk the room and listen to group discussions.  Identify a few key points or themes from the small group discussions that you might want to share with the whole group |
| 5 min | Close the session with reviewing the outcomes and highlighting a few talking points from discussions. Remind students to respond to the survey questions on this session in their afternoon retro. |  |
