* GABBY - small groups of 4 or 5, put discussion questions on board. Say "Go in order". (any way works, we will join groups, to keep them on time and on topic) - 15 minutes
* MIKE facilitates - then get back together and those on one end of the spectrum have to share benefits or drawbacks (depending, and avoid the word 'argue') synthesize into 3 points and send one person to write it on the board. - 7 minutes
* MIKE - open it up for discussion - however long we need

### Discussion Questions
1. How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire? 
2. Who are the winners and losers in automation?
3. What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue? 
4. What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?
