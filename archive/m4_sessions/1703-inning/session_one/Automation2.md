## Session Outline

| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points           | Participant/Facilitator Actions  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 5 min | Introduction: Welcome participants.  Introduce yourself and your role.  Review the outcomes for the session and the connection to the greater Turing mission. | Intro. |
| 2 min | Introduce video and reflection questions to students. <br> 1) How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire? <br> 2) Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes? <br> 3) What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue? <br> 4) What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?  <br> | Facilitor will display questions on screen. Students get out paper and pen to prepare for video. |
| 15 min | Kick off ["David Autor: Will automation take away all our jobs?"](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_autor_why_are_there_still_so_many_jobs) video. | Students should take notes during the video.  Ask them to put away cell phones/computers if needed. |
| 5 min | Warm Up: Kick off an activity where students will organize in the room along a spectrum of their attitudes toward automation. Describe one end as representing people who feel strongly that automation is, as Elon Musk says, "summoning a demon." On the other end, people who feel automation is going to take humanity to new, positive, exciting potential. | Facilitator will instruct students to line up in between these poles as appropriate. At facilitator's prompting, students should line up along the spectrum of attitudes toward automation. |
| 10 min | Introduce discussion section: Students should identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing. After individual sharing, the group facilitator can help the group decide what themes from people's writing to discuss in more depth. | Facilitator: walk the room and listen to group discussions.  Identify a few key points or themes from the small group discussions that you might want to share with the whole group |
| 8 min | Introduce share out section: Students should summarize the major points from their small group discussions. | Facilitator: Groups should share out a summary at first, before opening to full group discussion/reflection. |
| 5 min | Invite students to reflect further on the questions in writing. | Students should be writing. |
| 5 min | Close the session with reviewing the outcomes and highlighting a few talking points from discussions. Remind students to respond to the survey questions on this session in their afternoon retro. |  |
