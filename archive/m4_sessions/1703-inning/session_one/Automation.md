## Group Eight's Session Plan

M4 Student Leaders: Mike, Justin, Jesse, Ethan, Dan

# Turing Career Development: Automation

## Session Outcomes

## Mission Alignment		 
  		  
*Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.
  		  
As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually. Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.

## Pre-Session


### Survey Questions
Survey to be sent either prior to session or immediately after ( prior may lead to better response? )

#### Survey to lighten the mood
  * funny questions like:
   1. When the robots attack, what’s the first thing you do?
   2. If you could have one process in your life automated tomorrow what would it be?
   3. What automated process today do you appreciate the most
   4. Write your apology to the person whose job you stole by automating that thing.
   
### Pre-Reading

Send pre-reading out at least 24 hours before the session

### Groupings
  We will group members by opposing stances. Have students sit in a spectrum of how much they like the idea of automation, and from that hand select one each from opposing sides and a middle. This should facilitate the most conversation and opposing viewpoints.
  
 ## Session Outline

| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points           | Participant/Facilitator Actions  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 5 min | Introduction: Welcome participants.  Introduce yourself and your role.  Review the outcomes for the session and the connection to the greater Turing mission.  Ask students about survey, and read out some responses.
| 5 min | Warm Up: Kick off an activity where students will organize in the room along a spectrum of their attitudes toward automation. Describe one end as representing people who feel strongly that automation is, as Elon Musk says, "summoning a demon." On the other end, people who feel automation is going to take humanity to new, positive, exciting potential. | Facilitator will instruct students to line up in between these poles as appropriate. At facilitator's prompting, students should line up along the spectrum of attitudes toward automation. This arrangement will be used to select dynamic groups |
| 2 min | Introduce video and reflection questions to students. <br> 1) How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire? <br> 2) Where do you think you fall across the spectrum of people that will be affected by these changes? <br> 3) What do you think it means to be a responsible citizen around this issue? <br> 4) What role can Turing play in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring?     
| 0 min | ----------|.
| 15 mins | One of these videos will be shown, to be selected after quick meeting before session. <br> 1. Kick off ["Humans Need Not Apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) video. <br> 2. Kick off ["Do labor-saving robots spell doom for American workers?"](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/labor-saving-robots-spell-doom-american-workers/) video | Students should take notes during the video.  Ask them to put away cell phones/computers if needed.
| 13 min | Introduce discussion section: Students should identify a timekeeper, a faciliator, and a notetaker.  Each student 
should spend about 2 minutes sharing what surfaced during their writing. After individual sharing, the group facilitator can help the group decide what themes from people's writing to discuss in more depth. | Facilitator: walk the room and listen to group discussions.  Identify a few key points or themes from the small group discussions that you might want to share with the whole group |

### A second video will be shown to close out the session.
  The video will be selected as a more positive ( if possible ) solution or pros to the topic of automation. Video is meant to offer a new perspective and possible change in mood as the session closes.. Hopefully to foster creative thought and less negativity.. or more thoughts on possible solutions.
