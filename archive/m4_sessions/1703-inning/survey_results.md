## Student responses:
* This is one of my favorite topics of debate, so I'm really excited that it's being discussed at gear up. It's very important to be aware of the direct and indirect consequences of our actions, even as we think we are doing a positive thing for society, we must be aware of the negative implications, especially with our current political climate driving deregulation and removal of safety nets.
* I think automation is really awesome. Maybe I feel differently because I don't feel like it will effect me that much in my lifetime, but eventually it will create more problems to solve and a different lifestyle for humans. I don't think humans will run out of things to do. The idea that humans will die out because robots do everything is completely asinine.
* If I am going to be part of the cause for humanity's loss of jobs, I believe I also need to be part of the answer.
* Because at some point me or someone I know will be affected by automation, especially in terms of job security
* I think this is incredibly important. To be honest, I am not sure it's something I've thought enough about but, as a former economics major, it's something I plan to dive into. I think encourage good, ethical governance is the first step but will be digging further.
* One, it helps validate my decision to get into this field because someone has to program the automation :). Two, it's incredibly important to be informed because who likes getting blind sided or left without a job? I can understand that it's all ebbs and flows. For instance, how long after cars became a thing did it take for there to be a high demand for car mechanics? Sometimes an issue takes time to surface before it creates an industry? Great gear up. Lots of food for thought.
* It matters to me because we should be aware about the implications of automation and how we can assist those in our own lives who have lost their jobs because of it. I also, though my group disagreed, think that companies should bear some responsibility to pass the benefits of automation onto their workers and that's something you can advocate for in your workplace... Also, since it is inevitable and the human cost is huge- it's important to push the govt to meet peoples' needs as unemployment rises (universal basic income, healthcare, education, etc...) Since the govt is unlikely to do that, it's important that people share resources within their own communities...
* As developers, we are the future of automation. We need to be able to recognize that the world doesn't revolve around us and that others are affected by the work we do. In the video, they mentioned that people in silicon valley tend to live in a bubble and cannot seem to think about those who do not have the same privileges. I was shocked that someone in the small group discussion I was in seemed to have that same mindset. (not someone from our class, thank goodness). I think it is extremely important to realize that you must think outside of just your own life, and that not everyone is as fortunate as you. I am really glad that we talked about this and I hope that people learned from it.
* It's SUPER important I think. The societal implications are massive. As software developers, we might be some of the people who's jobs last the longest in terms of availability. Artificial intelligence is written by software engineers, and even traditionally safe jobs will being to be overtaken by the bots. I think this issue will become one of the most major societal problems as we move forward and it's really up to us to determine which direction it will take us all. I think without some form of basic income or incentives to redistrubute income, the average plebeian is totally fucked without proper education or some form of safety net. This will be the issue that defines our generation and perhaps the entire human race. It's why I got into this field.
* I think we as developers need to advocate for radical structural and attitudinal changes to accommodate the mass unemployment that is already taking place.
* I have many thoughts on this and they all lead to the topic of singularity and shelters for the apocalypse.
* Because the robots are already better than me at Javascript, and I feel morally obligated to not allow billions of people to live in poverty and despair like Jerry Kaplan predicts. I'm not sure I buy his predications, however, and take great issue with his horse analogy.
* Because it may put me out of a job! and i may participate/be an authority in deciding the direction of automation in some sense one day.
* Aware of things happening; gear up could have been more balanced
* we build for those across the world, which means we should understand their concerns
* Its coming and we might as well be the ones who make the tech work for us.
* It will hugely impact the economy in the future, it is good to have a conversation about it.
* It means that we can plan for the future, and hopefully take action to educate and help others through the economic changes that seem to be impending.
* Since we are going into an industry where we have the ability to affect huge amounts of change in this exact area, it is our responsibility to be informed about the ways we can make act to improve the lives of people our technologies are affecting. I also think that while a common piece of feedback for these gear ups is "they only show one side", I think objectivity is largely a myth and does us a disservice. We need to be **respectful** of people who have opinions that differ from the norm, but that doesn't mean there can't be an institutional opinion. (Provided, of course, we have the freedom to disagree with that opinion.)
* Because I don't want unfair wealth redistribution and deeper income inequality.
* I wish this had also explored the other side of the issue. Surely there are resources that aren't the "doom and gloom" of automation
* It just reminds me we're fucked. I don't like to think about it
* Best gear up
* This is heavy meta material, and important to keep in mind. If you don't think about the larger pattern your work is a part of, your decision making is less intentional by default.
* It matters because I can choose to shift automation in a more positive direction.
* best gear up so far. would love to see more along this vein. the realization that it's our responsibility to ensure that the bounteous wealth to be generated by automation get distributed evenly amongst the population, not just the rich
* For me, more than anything it was simply an eye-opening session. The conversation in the video from the horses' point of view was especially enlightening.
* Being informed about the impact of automation brings with it the responsibility to fight for a minimum basic income, irrespective of skill-set.
* We are the people who are going to be responsible for making this change happen, so it is up to us to make it good for people and inclusive.
* Still a really open/weird category.
* I think this is, so far, the absolute most necessary GearUp we've had so far. This topic has affected and will continue to affect our lives every day, and it was a great choice.
* Because we are going to be building the tools that will contribute to advancing automation, and we need to be aware of the consequences of our work in the world.
