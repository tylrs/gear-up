**Session Title: Social Movements And Technology**

**Description:**

In an increasingly technological world, there is an opportunity for those of us with the ability to write in the language of technology to play an oversized role in the direction of humanity. In this session, participants will be exposed to a number of social movements and the ways technology has played a role in them and then be given the opportunity to explore their own interests and ways they can make an impact. Participants will end the session with a tangible plan of action for their own personal involvement as developers after Turing.

**Session Outcomes:** What will students leave with or gain from this session?

A personal mission statmement/committment to the role they will play as a developer in making their communities a better place

**3. Activate:** (25 minutes)

Individual Exercise within Groups 

_We'll split the room into 5 groups and each of the presenters will sit with a group to push the conversation forward._

- (10 minutes) Think about a movement you are passionate about and think about ways you can be involved as a developer - the distinction being that we are focused on how we can use our skills to further the development of technology that helps social movements for good (not use technology)
  - ****Worksheet****
    - Who/what are the sides? What are their perpsectives/motivations?
    - What is being tried/has already been tried? 
    - How can technology help push the movement forward?

- (5 minutes) Write down some committments you want to make to being an active voice in/contributor to the movement/s you care about

- (10 minutes) Small group share out & discussions (3-4 people max)


**4. Share out:** (10 minutes)
- What is your personal committment (post Turing) to benefit the greater good as a developer (i.e. with your new skills)?
