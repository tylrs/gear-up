Group Six

Session Title: "Learning a new programming language"

Session Title:Description: Here at Turing, we all learn how to be awesome developers in Javascript and/or Ruby on Rails. Once you ascend from the basement and enter the real world, your company will probably work in a language/framework you have never used before. That can be pretty intimidating. Come learn about new languages we are excited about, and see how jumping into a new one isn't as scary as it looks.

### Session layout:
* 10 min: "Would you rather?" Icebreaker/Introduction (Everyone)
* 5 min: Intro with StackOverflow survey statistics (most common languages, average number of languages devs know, charts) (JF)
* 5 min: Explain Object-oriented vs Functional Programming, and Statically- vs dynamically-typed langs. (Mike)
* 15 min: Code-along. Students will navigate while JF and Jack drive code for mythical creatures in Ruby on one screen and    JavaScript on the other. (JF & Jack)
* 20 min: Elm
  * 5 min Hello World example (Jack)
  * 5 min presentation (Tyler)
