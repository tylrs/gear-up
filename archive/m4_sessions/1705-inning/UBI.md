## Mission Alignment
Overall mission of this gearup: We want to leave people with an understanding of what UBI is and that is a discussion that should happen outside of patisan politics.  We need more experimentation and information to determine if this is a viable way to care for our citizens. 

Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.

As your technical careers progress, most of the work you will do is to automate processes that have been done manually.
Our mission is to “unlock human potential.” The software we write enables it’s users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward
solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs
they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.

## Outline
1. Into/ General UBI info - We will start with a base definition set for the group.  We will lead a brief discusion about what the group already knows.  Then get a list of initial pros and cons on the board - 10 min
2. General UBI info video.  Here we will encourage the group to reflect on how this video challenges some of their assumptions about UBI- 10min
3. Break into small groups (we will count off into four groups) and discuss pros and cons further. We will let them know we will share what the groups discussed before they break out. - 15 min
4. Come back together and write the pros and cons on the board and reflect on what was learned in the groups- We will call on the groups to share what they discussed.  10 min
5. Thought Experiment - As a group led by us while we play devil's advocate- See below for details 20 min
6. Reflect on the discussion and what take aways they got from the session- 5 min

## Group Discussion

  In groups of 3-4 come up with at least four pros to UBI and four cons. We will come back together as a group and put pros and cons
  on the board, then as a group you will discuss the pros and cons of UBI.

## Thought Experiment:
  We will describe an industry that is currently flourishing but will, in the next 5-10 years be completely automated (warehouses, trucking, gig economy stuff like uber).  As a developer, you have been tasked with building the software that will lead this automation.  This will but 100,000 people out of work.  How do you feel about this and how do you think society should offer support to these people?  Do you think they should be taken care of by the government or are they on their own? 
  
  Then we will reverse the discussion and tell them they are now in the position of one of the displaced workers.  What is their plan for making a living now?  If they want to go to school to learn something new, how will they pay for it? Should they be expected to find a job that is paying below what they were earning just because it is now done by a machine?
