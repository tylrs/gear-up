## Name of Session: Why emotional intelligence matters

## Session Description

Drop in to learn how emotional intelligence can make you a better developer.


## Session Outcomes


Students will learn a basic framework for understanding emotional intelligence and put their new skills into practice with a group exercise.


## Session Outline


 1. Introductions (15 - 20 minutes, lead by , see slide deck for intro format )
    - Icebreaker
 2. Intro to ei - Description and surface level explanation. (5 minutes, slides 3-6, lead by )
 3. Video and discussion (20 minutes)
    - 3 - 5 minute video
    - 15 minute discussion
    - Share with room
    - One person from each group: what stood out amongst what you   HEARD in your small group discussions?

 4. Group activity (20 - 30 minutes)
    - Follows this format : https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/40880/a-simple-exercise-to-strengthen-emotional-intelligence-in-teams
    - Option 1 or Option 2 depending on time left after the discussion

 5. Wrap up discussion (10 minutes)
    - When you imagine your future, as a developer, what role 
  does emotional intelligence (both your own and othersâ€™) 
  play in that vision?
    - Any relationship is a two-way street. How do your EI needs/expectations of others      	
  compare/contrast to the role of EI in your own internal 
  (mental) life? 
    - It is not reasonable to expect others to accommodate needs of which they are simply not aware...
        - how can you improve your own introspection habits in order to better understand your own emotional needs/expectations? 
        - What could you do to communicate these needs/expectations more clearly to those around you?
        - How might this impact the chances of developing healthy, satisfying relationships?
    - How will you improve your own EI, in order to make a 
  positive contribution to the Turing community? Set one goal 
  for yourself, related to emotional intelligence, to focus 
  on during the remainder of your time here at Turing.

# Notes
 - Like the activity to exercise to strengthen emotional intelligence
 - Like the progression of the session
 - Don't like the reading of articles - instead show a video and have them break out into groups to discuss it
 - Make sure questions are
 - How do we want groups to share?
   - Break down walls at the beginning - change introductions so that they are more interactive
   - 15 minutes
 - Change introduction
