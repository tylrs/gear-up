# Session Title: Transforming your Narrative through Growth Mindset

# Description: Why should students come to this session?

# Session Outcomes: What will students leave with or gain from this session? 

  Students will be able to:
    Identify when they are in a fixed mindset.
    Identify techniques to remove themselves from the fixed mindset into a growth mindset. 
    Identify an area that they want to transition into a growth mindset.
    Express the difference between having a growth mindset and remaining constantly positive. !!(ask as a thought provoking question during idea introduction)!!
    Express their failures through the lens of a growth mindset, and understand their failure as a learning tool. 
    Support other students who are currently in a fixed-mindset. !!(Ask students, when they were in a fixed mindset, how others might help them move beyond it)!!
  

# Session Outline: Include the flow of the session and the time for each section.

 ALL 10 minutes - Introductions/Why we decided to provide this Gearup. Share why we think we need this GearUp, what in our own personal journey has caused us to experience. 
 
 15 Minutes - Students will be provided a difficult coding challenge to see how they respond to it. After the really difficult challenge, we will spend 5 minutes identifying aspects of fixed mindset that they experienced during the code challenge. The idea here is not to "catch" people who are experiencing fixed mindsets, but rather allow everyone to have a shared experience of fixed mindsets and recognize how they behave when they feel challenged.
    -- "What were you feeling during the challenge?"
    -- "What were some behaviors that you experienced during the challenge?"
    -- Having student journal their internal narrative during this code challenge. 
    
Francy 10 minutes - Students will identify an area that they are in a fixed mindset. Students will think of a time they they felt a fixed mindset, whether it was during Turing or before. Are there areas in the future where you feel that you're feeling fixed?
    - 4 minutes thinking this through, 2 minutes pair and share, and then 4 minutes of group share. 
    
 4 minutes - Modeling the infographic exercise.

 16 minutes - Students will pair up with another person and work through the infographic, using the fixed experience that they came up with during the previous activity. Students will take note of what they could have done differently or what techniques they could have employed.
 
 8 minutes - Angelela DuckWorth Grit: The Power of Perseverence and Passion.

 7 Minutes - Students will write down a new narrative for themselves going into a future challenge. 

ALL 5 Minutes - We will open up the conversation so that students can share their new narratives. 

Know that this experience has prepared you for failure. Being mindful of this failure and accepting of the fact that we can grow from our failures will allow us to perservere and succeed. 

## New Ideas

Introduce fixed and growth mindsets and then give students scenarios and ask them to decide if each is a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.

Assign groups based on mixing together introverts and extroverts. Use cards that are color coded by how introverted or extroverted the students are then sort them into piles for each of us to run as small groups with a mixture of each color.

Groups of 4 for small discussions and regroup to share small group ideas.

Discuss techniques for moving out of a fixed mindset before infographic exercise.

Use whiteboard to make a list of symptoms of fixed mindset and a list of techniques for moving towards a growth mindset.

Instead of a coding challenge do a paper puzzle. - Will
