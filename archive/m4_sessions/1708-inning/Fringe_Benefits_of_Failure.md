## Reflect (5 min)
Take an opportunity to think about what you watched and read. Think about what stood out to you in those pieces. You may use your notebook or computer to write down some of your thoughts or stories you may want to share.

1. Have you ever been challenged to test your limits by a failure you have experienced? What did you learn about yourself? What might have surprised you about that situation?
2. What valuable lessons have you learned from your own personal failures or from a failure someone else you are close to has experienced?
3. How can you use these lessons moving forward in your time at Turing and your time out of Turing?
4. Considering the failures you have experienced, think about how other people responded to them. What was helpful? What was hurtful? How can you use these experiences to support other people in your cohort.

## Discuss (20 min)
Find a group of 4 from your cohort. Groups should be no larger than 4.

Make sure to assign someone in your group the role of timekeeper, facilitator, and listening monitor to remind everyone to practice active listening. Take collective responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

These topics can be very personal and difficult to talk about. Please respect other students privacy and their degree of willingness to share their story. Keep in mind that support, kindness, and a quiet mind will go a long way in understanding one another.

## Closing (5 min)
After listening to your peers' thoughts write down further reflections in your notebook or on your computer.

1. After you have heard stories from other students what surprised you about the things they learned from their failures. What stood out to you about your own failures?
2. What has changed your thoughts about failure? What has stayed the same?
3. Moving forward how can you support someone you know who is going through a hard time?
4. If you experience a failure in your future, what are some things you have learned from this session that would make it a bit easier?
