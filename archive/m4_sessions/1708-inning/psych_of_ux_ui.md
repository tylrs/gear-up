### Session Outline:
_We'll use a keynote slide deck to guide the session, which will be shared out at the end of the session_

Intro to UX/UI (~10 minutes)
* Facilitators introduce themselves, go around the room and do introductions and answer what ux/ui means to you

Design Thinking Video (~15 minutes)
* Video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFffb2H-gK0 (8:41 // A video produced by the Florida Hospital Innovation Labs covering the 5 different stages of design thinking, which are _empathy_, _reframe_, _brainstorming_, _prototype_, _testing_)
* Video 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXtN4y3O35M (5:51 // A quick five minute video analyzing IBM's design thinking approach to Agile development. IBM expands upon traditional design thinking by aiming at meeting the needs of large scale enterprises without sacrificing the personal focus of design thinking. The process starts with the end user and understanding what needs the user has that are not being met. Once a need is identified, the design team writes out as many design ideas as they can think of and slowly weed them out. The one that is left is then given to developers to create a working model.)

Leader Group Exercise (10 minutes)
* Session facilitators will each talk about what they think is great/bad design with examples

Share principles of Simplicity (~10 minutes)
* Visual examples of good design and bad design, with some explanations as to why

Small Group Exercise (15 minutes of research/talking, 10 minutes of sharing)
* Will break out into groups of 4 or 5 people, and have groups find examples of good design and bad design, and share with the rest of the class with explanations as to why
