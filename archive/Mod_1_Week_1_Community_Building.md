# Community Building

[Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kMjVrNg2uCVT1GxXDgnauzUfBL8qixtsf86HZNGY9b0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Setup
Ask students to move all desks to the sides of the room and make a circle (offer option to sit on chairs to be inclusive of all abilities, encourage people to stand if they are able)

## Intro/Background - 3 min
Intro-
We are going to spend the next two hours participating in community building activities. Turing is a collaborative and participatory space. It is important to get to know the people 
you will be sharing this experience with. 

Theater of the Oppressed Background-
Created by Brazilian visionary, Augusto Boal, Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) is a form of popular community based education that uses theater as a tool for transformation. 
Originally developed out of Boal’s work with peasant and worker populations, it is now used all over the world for social and political activism, conflict resolution, 
community building, therapy, and government legislation. Inspired by the vision of Paulo Freire and his landmark treatise on education, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, T.O. 
invites critical thinking. It is about analyzing rather than accepting, questioning rather than giving answers. It is also about “acting” rather than just talking. In T.O., 
the audience is not made of spectators but “spect-actors”. Through the evocative language of theatre, everyone is invited to share their opinion on the issues at hand. 
We are using T.O. today for community building and you will use it in Gear Ups in the future.

## Games
**Name and Gesture** - 15 min
The group stands in a circle. The leader introduces themself with their name followed by an alliteration and a gesture (ex. Sassy Sarah with a hand snap motion). 
The whole group repeats the name and the gesture. Each individual goes around the circle saying their name, alliteration and gesture. After everyone has gone once,
the leader lets students know you are going to go around one more time with name, alliteration, and gesutre without the group repeating back before a name memorization 
game where a person will say someone else's name, alliteration, and gesture to pass it to them and they will call on someone else. Repeat until everyone's name and gesture 
has been called.

**Origin of Name** - 15 min
The group goes in a circle sharing the origin of their name. Can be any atecdote that comes to mine. No pressure! Facilitator can make connections to: value of understanding 
where people come from, telling your own story, connecting on difference and similarity, etc.

**Everybody Go** -15 min
In a circle one student volunteers to go first and says "Everybody go..." and then does something (preferably a sound and a movement). Everyone in the circle first says "YES!" 
and then repeats whatever they just did as exactly as possible. The next person does their sound and movement in a clockwise direction. Repeat 1-2 times. Connect to getting 
comfortable with discomfort, anticipatory anxiety, cohort connection of being in the unknown together, etc.

## Break - 5 min
Take a 5 minute break!

## Accountabilabuddies
Intro- 2 min
Turing is fast-paced and high stress. Sometimes even asking for help can feel overwhelming. We want to eliminate some of that stress by pairing you with Mod 1 Accountabilabuddies.
Accountabilabuddies are people you can rely on for pairing on code, mental health check ins, meal prep, and so much more. Consider DTR'ing (you learn about this more in PD) to set
specific goals, and parameterd for your pairs.

Activity- 
Part 1 - 30 min
Find your accountabilabuddy and answer these questions: 
* What was your first job? What still sticks with you from it?
* What’s the best class you ever took? Why?
* What led you to enroll at Turing?
* What about your past experiences is most relevant to being a student at Turing?
* How does being a student at Turing fit into the narrative arc of your life?
* If you could snap your fingers and change one thing about your personality, what would it be?
* What’s the growth/change you’re most proud of from the last 5 years?
* When do you rely on other people? For what?
* What scares you about being a student at Turing?
* What will make your life feel like it was a success?

Part 2 -10 min
In accountabilabuddy pairs Define the Relationship:
* How do you want to use your accountabilabuddy?
* How frequently do you want to meet?
* Do you want to be held accountable to any goals?
* What else?

Reflection- 5 min
* Have students share back ideas they have for using their accountabilabuddies, maintaining mental health and well being, 
anything they learned about their buddy that their buddy is comfortable sharing.

## Lunch Discussions- 3 min
In week two and three Mod 2 students will facilitate lunch discussions for you to check in and process how you are adjusting 
to Turing. This is an opportunity to check in on emotional well being and stress management, not talk about code! Review slides
for group. 

## Closing T.O. Games
**Two By Three By Bradford**
In pairs begin counting 1,2,3 and alternating turns. Once that has been mastered replace 1 with a sound, once that has been 
mastered replace 2 with a movement, once that has been mastered replace 3 with a movement and a sound. By the end of the game 
students should not be saying any numbers and should be communicating with sounds and movements.

and/or

**Move, Stop, Name, Clap**
Move, Stop, Name, Clap is a physical and mental warm-up that involves listening and body awareness. It begins with simple prompts 
that students respond to as they move through an open space. Later, when the facilitator announces the meanings of prompts are switched, 
students must remember the new meaning for each prompt and the corresponding action.

Directions: 
Define the playing area and invite students to walk silently around the space. Encourage students to be aware of their pathways and change 
walking patterns often, while remaining aware of the rest of the group. Introduce the prompt “stop”: students freeze their bodies in place. 
Then, introduces “move”: students continue walking. Rehearse the prompts until they are understood. Next, introduce “clap”: students clap. 
The final prompt is “name”: students state their name out loud once. Once all the vocabulary and responses are clear play the game by alternating 
through different prompts. Next explain that prompts will begin to swap beginning with swapping “stop” and “move” with each other, so that when 
students hear “stop,” they start walking and when they hear “move” they freeze. Switch the actions of “clap” with “name.” 

For both of these games connect to learning new languages through code, leaving security to take risk, rewiring brain for this environment
can feel challenging and stressful but it will be accompanied by laughter and reward along the way.

## Closing Dialogue- 
Have students reflect on: 
* How Theater of the Oppressed relates to time at Turing. 
* Take aways from accountabilabuddies.
* Ways students are going to maintain well being while at Turing.
